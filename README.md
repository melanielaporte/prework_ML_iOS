- Connects to my weight scale seamlessly.
- Charts my measurements and weight in text and a graph.
- What it's missing: a comment feature for weighin notes.

### Ideas
I would like to build an mini The Sims app that is a pet users can play on the go, similar to a [Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi).
