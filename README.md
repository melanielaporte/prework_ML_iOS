## Submission Checklist
<p>✅ User can run application showing a screen with a button and at least a couple of labels.</p>

## Some ideas to improve the app are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background and a title.
- Add more pages
- More functionality
### App Demo (please wait, there's a delay)

## App Idea Brainstorming

### Here are my favorite 3 applications and the 2 features that make them my favorite app
#### 1. FitIndex
- Connects to my weight scale seamlessly.
- Charts my measurements and weight in text and a graph.
- What it's missing: a comment feature for weighin notes.
#### 2. Slack
- App and desktop function exactly the same, no user issues.
- Select notification option.
#### 3. Go (bus transit app)
- Easy to buy and store tickets
- Simple time countdown displaying how much time is left on a ticket.
  
### Ideas
I would like to build an mini The Sims app that is a pet users can play on the go, similar to a [Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi).
